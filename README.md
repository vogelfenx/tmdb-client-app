## Mobile App for movies

The application serves movies from [TMDB database](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) using their API and displays it as a list.
There is also a detailed view, where a movie's description, rating and poster are displayed.  
For example:  
<img src="./resource/movie-list.jpg" alt="Example of list with movies" height="500" style="margin-right:20px"/>
<img src="./resource/movie-detail.jpg" alt="Example of movie's detail page" height="500"/>
